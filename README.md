# TicTacToe
🌈 Game Overview:
Join the fun in this classic game of tic-tac-toe, now with a twist of X and O images! It's a battle between two players – one represented by an X image and the other by an O image. The goal is to get three of your images in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

🔢 Game Board:
Here's the game board, represented by a 3x3 grid:
Players take turns placing their X or O images on the board by choosing a number corresponding to an empty spot.

🤖 How to Play:
Player X goes first, placing their X image on an empty spot.
Player O follows, marking their moves with an O image.
The game continues until one player gets three X or O images in a row or the board is filled.

🏆 Winning:
If a player gets three of their X or O images in a row, they win! If the board is filled and no one has three in a row, it's a draw.

👾 Have Fun and Enjoy!
May the best image strategist win! Play, laugh, and share the joy of Tic-Tac-Toe with your friends and family. Happy gaming! 🎈🎉
